# Object_Detection
1. Image Capture through Webcam- Custom Object Dataset creation
2. Object Detection through online Tool for Training and Validation using the Custom Dataset

OS - Windows

Requirements:
1. IDE - Pycharm 
2. Python version - 3.9
3. Module used - cv2
4. Tool - SentiSight.ai

Overview:

Computer Vision plays one of the main role in object detction, Regognition and Classifiaction. Object Detection focuses on the IOU over the objects present in an image using the IOU score between the Ground truth bounding and predicted bounding.

The task of Creating Custom Image Dataset for the Object Detection Training and Validation involves the capturing of specific number of images per object considered  through the use of webcam or external camera devices connected to the Desktop device.

Following steps Involved in creating a custom image dataset:

STEP 1: Importing necessary "Opencv" module used to capture and render the image using the laptop camera i.e WEBCAM.

STEP 2: Creating the Camera object

STEP 3: Creating the Webcam Frame and ROI bounding box inside the frame

STEP 4: Captured Image Saving into labeled folders


Similarly the task of object detection training and validation for the Custom dataset created is done using the online tool as an Automated process for detection and training using the Sentisight.ai free platform which is uploaded in the **WEBM** format for the brief intro about the tool and further explanation about the usage, Labelling, Training and Validation using the tool.
